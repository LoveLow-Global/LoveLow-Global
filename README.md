# Hi, I'm Jihyung Kim

I am triple majoring in Creative Technology Management, Mathematics, and Cognitive Science at Yonsei University (although I will likely drop one of the three majors before graduation), and currently a Computer Science exchange student at Dartmouth College. Passionate about **Graphs / Networks** and **NLP / Machine Learning**.

Currently based in New Hampshire, US.

## Ongoing Projects

These are my ongoing projects / researches.

### 1. [Bernoulli-Directed Divisor Graphs and its Largest SCC](https://github.com/LoveLow-Global/BDDG_LCC)
*(Dartmouth College, May 2025-Present)*
* **Focus:** Graphs, Probability Theory, Number Theory
* **Discovery:** Discovered that a randomly directed divisor graph forms a largest Strongly Connected Component (SCC) with unique, previously unseen properties.

### 2. Comparison between Classical Chinese and Modern Languages in Language Model Pre-Training
*(Dartmouth College, Oct 2025-Present)*
* **Focus:** Natural Language Processing, Large Language Models, ALBERT, Artificial Intelligence
* **Project:** Executing an NLP study utilizing ALBERT models to quantify and compare performance across historical and modern corpora of languages, including Modern English and Classical / Modern Chinese.

### 3. [K-Pop Agenda Dynamics: A Comparative Analysis of Topic Diffusion and Sentiment on News and Social Media](https://github.com/LoveLow-Global/kpop-agenda-sentiment)
*(Yonsei University, Mar 2025-Apr 2025 & Nov 2025-Present)*
* **Focus:** Natural Language Processing, Topic Modeling, Information Diffusion
* **Project** Analyzing K-pop related articles by sorting them into distinct agenda topics, then comparing the characteristics of community response and sentiment diffusion across different online communities.

## Background

Before coming to college, I used to be an **Esports Analyst and Coach**, implementing data-informed strategies and directing remote coaching for professional teams across Japan, North America, and Taiwan.

I used to be a **Teaching Assistant** at Yonsei University, where I gave lectures one hour per week and provided support for the Computer Programming and Literacy course, in a class of 28 students.

I love snowboarding in winter, try to find me on the slopes! In other seasons, I play baseball.
